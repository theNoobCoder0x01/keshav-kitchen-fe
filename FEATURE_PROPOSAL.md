# Keshav Kitchen Feature Proposal

## Overview
This document proposes new features and improvements for the Keshav Kitchen application to enhance user experience, maintainability, and functionality.

## Proposed Features

### 1. Dynamic Data Loading
- **Description**: Replace hardcoded data in components like `reports-grid.tsx` with dynamic API calls to fetch real-time data.
- **Benefits**: Ensures data is current and reflects actual kitchen operations, improving decision-making.
- **Implementation**: Create API endpoints for reports data and integrate with existing data fetching mechanisms.

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Flow
- **Description**: Implement a more robust authentication flow with role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Benefits**: Improves security by ensuring users only access features relevant to their roles (e.g., admin vs. staff).
- **Implementation**: Extend NextAuth configuration to include role checks and update UI to conditionally render based on user roles.

### 3. UI Design System
- **Description**: Establish a comprehensive design system with reusable components and consistent theming.
- **Benefits**: Enhances visual consistency across the app and speeds up development of new features.
- **Implementation**: Document design tokens (colors, typography) and create a library of reusable components with Storybook integration for testing.

### 4. Inventory Management Module
- **Description**: Add a new module for tracking inventory levels of ingredients.
- **Benefits**: Helps in managing stock, reducing waste, and planning purchases.
- **Implementation**: Develop new API endpoints for inventory data, create UI for inventory tracking, and integrate with existing ingredient management.

### 5. Automated Testing Suite
- **Description**: Implement a suite of automated tests including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Benefits**: Ensures code quality and prevents regressions as the codebase grows.
- **Implementation**: Use Jest for unit testing, React Testing Library for component testing, and Cypress for E2E testing.

## Prioritization
- High Priority: Dynamic Data Loading, Enhanced Authentication Flow
- Medium Priority: UI Design System, Inventory Management Module
- Low Priority: Automated Testing Suite (can be phased in gradually)

## Next Steps
- Review these proposals with stakeholders.
- Prioritize and plan implementation phases.
- Begin with high-priority features to address immediate needs.

Please provide feedback on these proposals to refine and finalize the development roadmap.
